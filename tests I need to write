If we make an assignment, and Person A has access to the assignment, they can submit to it.
  They can then see that submission.
  So can their tutor.
  So can their convener.
  Other students can't see it.

  They can comment on the assignment.
  So can conveners.
    All of them can see the comments.

  The convener can set marks.
    The student can see these marks.

  The convener can't set marks which are too high or low.

All of this stuff works with both a plain text submission and a zip submission:
  If we have two students who have submitted, and we set up the peer review cycle "swap immediately" without the ability to mark
    One of them gets access to the other's assignment.
    He can comment on it.
    He can't mark it.

  If we set it up as previous, but with the ability to mark
    The peer can mark it
    The peer can't mark it in an invalid fashion
    That mark is visible to the peer
    That mark is visible to the student
    That mark is visible to the convener

  If we have two students, and we try to swap immediately to two other students, it fails.

  When the convener downloads the marks.csv file, he can see the grades he put, as well as the grades from peer review.
